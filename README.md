## Work in progress

This is a set of simplistic proof-of-concepts providing a basis for determining the best backend for a global localization platform.
It needs documentation and generalization, perhaps a starting point for some demos.

We covered :
1. graphql front end with MondgoDB backend
2. rest front end with MongoDB backend
3. rest front end with Postgres backend
